# Cider Tasting Website

Personal project site to track ciders I've tried and let me quickly look them up at a bar to see if I want to try them again (and/or if they're new). Responsive design, searchable table (using List.js), jQuery/Ajax data collection and display.

Data update form (not connected to live site): https://github.com/PeterBreen/cider-form
